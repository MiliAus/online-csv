        <p>As a younger person, I always enjoyed computers, video games, and learning about topics that were not interesting to most people. I strive to find a deeper explanation of most things in life, and will work tirelessly to master anything that comes my way.</p>
        <p>If I am not working on something on the computer, I like to play musical instruments or hang out with family.</p>
